# EGM 0.1.0

This is the first *CRAN* release for this package. 
The initial version contains key features for working with intracardiac electrograms (EGM) and surface electrocardiograms (ECG), visualizing signals, and working with annotations stored in the `WFDB` format.
A single, major class is introduced here.

- `egm` objects contain signal data and meta-data with specific dispatch methods, and are composed of three internal classes
	- a `signal_table` that contains the raw signal data
	- a `header_table` that contains meta-data about the signal data
	- an `annotation_table` that identifies samples and labels them with specific annotations

Additional I/O features are introduced to work with data stored in the `WFDB` format:

- `read_wfdb()` reads in `WFDB` data and returns an `egm` object
- `write_wfdb()` writes an `egm` object to a `WFDB`-compatible format

This first version also allows working with ECG and EGM data using:

- `read_muse()` for ECG data (GE MUSE, v9)
- `read_lspro()` for EGM data (LabSystem Pro)
