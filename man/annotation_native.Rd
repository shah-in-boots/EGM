\usage{
read_annotation_native(
  record,
  annotator,
  record_dir = ".",
  begin = 0,
  end = NA_real_,
  header = NULL
)

write_annotation_native(data, annotator, record, record_dir = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{record}{String that will be used to name the WFDB record. Cannot
include extensions, and is not a filepath. alphanumeric characters are
acceptable, as well as hyphens (-) and underscores (_)}

\item{annotator}{String that is the name of a WFDB-compatible annotation
type, serving as the extension for the file that is written containing that
annotation. Please see \code{\link[=read_annotation]{read_annotation()}} and \code{\link[=write_annotation]{write_annotation()}} for
further details.}

\item{record_dir}{File path of directory that should be used read and write
files. Defaults to current directory.}

\item{begin, end}{Optional numeric values (in seconds) defining the time range
to read. When either value is supplied, the record header must include a
valid sampling frequency.}

\item{header}{Optional \code{\link[=header_table]{header_table()}} used to supply metadata, including the
signal frequency. When omitted, \code{\link[=read_header_native]{read_header_native()}} is used to parse the
corresponding header file.}

\item{data}{An \code{annotation_table} containing the 6 invariant columns required
by the \code{\link[=annotation_table]{annotation_table()}} function}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{read_annotation_native()} returns an \code{\link[=annotation_table]{annotation_table()}} with elapsed time
strings, sample indices, annotation types, and associated qualifiers.
\item \code{write_annotation_native()} invisibly returns the path to the written
annotation file.
}
}
\description{
These functions provide native replacements for the WFDB \code{rdann} and \code{wrann}
utilities so that WFDB annotation files can be read and written without the
external WFDB library. The returned objects are compatible with the
\code{\link[=annotation_table]{annotation_table()}} class used throughout the package.
