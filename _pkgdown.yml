  title: Evaluating Cardiac Electrophysiological Signals
  description: >
    A system for importing electrophysiological signal into R, based on the
    Waveform Database(WFDB) software package. This package provides a wrapper
    for utilizing WFDB functions for reading and writing signal data in R, as
    well as functions for visualization and analysis. This package introduces a
    stable and compatible class for working with signal data, and supports
    reading in of specific, electrophysiogical file formats, including
    intracardiac electrograms.
