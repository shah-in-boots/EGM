Description: A system for importing electrophysiological signal, based
    on the 'Waveform Database (WFDB)' software package, written by Moody et al 
    2022 <doi:10.13026/gjvw-1m31>. A R-based system to utilize 'WFDB' functions
    for reading and writing signal data, as well as functions for visualization
    and analysis are provided. A stable and broadly compatible class for working
    with signal data, supporting the reading in of cardiac electrophysiological
    files such as intracardiac electrograms, is introduced.
